Making APIs requests with node. 

-Install the request library from npm 
-request('http://www.google.com', function(error, response, body){ 
    if(error){
        console.log("Something went wrong");
        console.log(error);
    } else if(response.statusCode == 200){
            //Things Worked!!
            console.log(body);
        }
        
we always pass 3 types of data to the callback function. 
It will 1st check for errors, 
If not, check response.statusCode, 
If succesfull (code 200) then will do something with the body.
